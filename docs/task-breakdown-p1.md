     - User can sign up and automatically create a workspace
     - User becomes admin of the new workspace
     - Graceful error handling if workspace creation fails
     - Proper audit logging for workspace creation
   - [x] **Invitation acceptance**: Complete invitation acceptance in `signupWithInvitation()`
     - Verifies invitation token validity and expiration
     - Validates signup email matches invitation email
     - Creates user account and adds to invited workspace
     - Assigns appropriate role from invitation
     - Comprehensive error handling and audit logging
   - [x] **Full invitation service integration**
     - Added workspace invitation creation endpoints (`POST /workspaces/:id/invitations`)
     - Integrated email sending for invitation notifications
     - Complete invitation management with token-based workflow
     - Proper audit logging for all invitation operations
   - [x] **Comprehensive audit logging system**
     - Enhanced audit logging across all services (Auth, Users, Workspace, DeviceSession)
     - Tracks user actions (signup, login, logout, profile updates)
     - Logs security events (failed logins, token refresh, session management)
     - Complete workspace and invitation audit trails
     - Device session management audit logging
